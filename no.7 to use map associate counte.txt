no.7 to use map associate counte 
ps.Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state name as an index and returns the population of the state

#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Creating a map with state names as keys and populations as values
    map<string, long> statePopulation;

    statePopulation["California"] = 39538223;
    statePopulation["Texas"] = 29145505;
    statePopulation["Florida"] = 21538187;
    statePopulation["New York"] = 20201249;
    statePopulation["Pennsylvania"] = 13002700;

    string state;
    cout << "Enter the name of a state: ";
    getline(cin, state); 

    auto it = statePopulation.find(state);
    if (it != statePopulation.end()) {
        cout << "The population of " << state << " is " << it->second << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "State not found in the database." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

op:-
Enter the name of a state: Texas
The population of Texas is 29145505
