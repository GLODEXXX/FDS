#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string data = "Hello, this is a sample text.";

    ofstream outFile("example.txt");
    if (outFile.is_open()) {
        outFile << data;
        cout << "Data written to file successfully.\n";
        outFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Error opening file for writing.\n";
        return 1;
    }

    ifstream inFile("example.txt");
    if (inFile.is_open()) {
        string content;
        getline(inFile, content);
        cout << "Data read from file: " << content << endl;
        inFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Error opening file for reading.\n";
        return 1;
    }
